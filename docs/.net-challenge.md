# Assignment

Create a simple browser-based chat application using .NET. This application should:

* Get stock quotes from an API using a specific command.

# Features

* [ ] Allow registered users to log in.
* [ ] Allow users to talk with other users in a chatroom.
* [ ] Allow users to post messages as commands into the chatroom.
  * [ ] The format of the commands is: `/stock={stockCode}`
* [ ] Create a decoupled bot that will call an API using the `{stockCode}` as a parameter.
  * [ ] The url is https://stooq.com/q/l/?s={stockCode}&f=sd2t2ohlcv&h&e=csv
* [ ] The bot should parse the received CSV file. 
  * [ ] It should send a message back into the chatroom.
  * [ ] Should use RabbitMQ. 
  * [ ] The message will be a stock quote.
    * [ ] The following format: `MSFT.US quote is $250.42 per share`. 
    * [ ] The post owner will be the bot.
* [ ] Have the chat messages ordered by their timestamps.
* [ ] Show only the last 50 messages.
